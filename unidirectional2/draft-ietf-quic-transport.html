<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs on top of UDP.  QUIC aims to provide a flexible set of features that allow it to be a general-purpose transport for multiple applications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">QUIC implements techniques learned from experience with TCP, SCTP and other transport protocols.  Using UDP as the substrate, QUIC seeks to be compatible with legacy clients and middleboxes.  QUIC authenticates all of its headers and encrypts most of the data it exchanges, including its signaling.  This allows the protocol to evolve without incurring a dependency on upgrades to middleboxes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document describes the core QUIC protocol, including the conceptual design, wire format, and mechanisms of the QUIC protocol for connection establishment, stream multiplexing, stream and connection-level flow control, and data reliability.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Accompanying documents describe QUIC&#8217;s loss detection and congestion control <a href="#QUIC-RECOVERY">[QUIC-RECOVERY]</a>, and the use of TLS 1.3 for key negotiation <a href="#QUIC-TLS">[QUIC-TLS]</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This section briefly describes QUIC&#8217;s key mechanisms and benefits.  Key strengths of QUIC include:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Low-latency connection establishment</li>
  <li>Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking</li>
  <li>Authenticated and encrypted header and payload</li>
  <li>Rich signaling for congestion control and loss recovery</li>
  <li>Stream and connection flow control</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#low-latency-connection-establishment" id="low-latency-connection-establishment">Low-Latency Connection Establishment</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">QUIC relies on a combined cryptographic and transport handshake for setting up a secure transport connection.  QUIC connections are expected to commonly use 0-RTT handshakes, meaning that for most QUIC connections, data can be sent immediately following the client handshake packet, without waiting for a reply from the server.  QUIC provides a dedicated stream (Stream ID 1) to be used for performing the cryptographic handshake and QUIC options negotiation.  The format of the QUIC options and parameters used during negotiation are described in this document, but the handshake protocol that runs on Stream ID 1 is described in the accompanying cryptographic handshake draft <a href="#QUIC-TLS">[QUIC-TLS]</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#stream-multiplexing" id="stream-multiplexing">Stream Multiplexing</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">When application messages are transported over TCP, independent application messages can suffer from head-of-line blocking.  When an application multiplexes many streams atop TCP&#8217;s single-bytestream abstraction, a loss of a TCP segment results in blocking of all subsequent segments until a retransmission arrives, irrespective of the application streams that are encapsulated in subsequent segments.  QUIC ensures that lost packets carrying data for an individual stream only impact that specific stream.  Data received on other streams can continue to be reassembled and delivered to the application.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> <a href="#rich-signaling-for-congestion-control-and-loss-recovery" id="rich-signaling-for-congestion-control-and-loss-recovery">Rich Signaling for Congestion Control and Loss Recovery</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">QUIC&#8217;s packet framing and acknowledgments carry rich information that help both congestion control and loss recovery in fundamental ways.  Each QUIC packet carries a new packet number, including those carrying retransmitted data.  This obviates the need for a separate mechanism to distinguish acknowledgments for retransmissions from those for original transmissions, avoiding TCP&#8217;s retransmission ambiguity problem.  QUIC acknowledgments also explicitly encode the delay between the receipt of a packet and its acknowledgment being sent, and together with the monotonically-increasing packet numbers, this allows for precise network roundtrip-time (RTT) calculation.  QUIC&#8217;s ACK frames support up to 256 ACK blocks, so QUIC is more resilient to reordering than TCP with SACK support, as well as able to keep more bytes on the wire when there is reordering or loss.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.4"><a href="#rfc.section.3.4">3.4.</a> <a href="#stream-and-connection-flow-control" id="stream-and-connection-flow-control">Stream and Connection Flow Control</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">QUIC implements stream- and connection-level flow control, closely following HTTP/2&#8217;s flow control mechanisms.  At a high level, a QUIC receiver advertises the absolute byte offset within each stream up to which the receiver is willing to receive data.  As data is sent, received, and delivered on a particular stream, the receiver sends WINDOW_UPDATE frames that increase the advertised offset limit for that stream, allowing the peer to send more data on that stream.  In addition to this stream-level flow control, QUIC implements connection-level flow control to limit the aggregate buffer that a QUIC receiver is willing to allocate to all streams on a connection.  Connection-level flow control works in the same way as stream-level flow control, but the bytes delivered and highest received offset are all aggregates across all streams.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.5"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5">3.5.</a> <a href="#authenticated-and-encrypted-header-and-payload" id="authenticated-and-encrypted-header-and-payload">Authenticated and Encrypted Header and Payload</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.1">TCP headers appear in plaintext on the wire and are not authenticated, causing a plethora of injection and header manipulation issues for TCP, such as receive-window manipulation and sequence-number overwriting.  While some of these are mechanisms used by middleboxes to improve TCP performance, others are active attacks.  Even &#8220;performance-enhancing&#8221; middleboxes that routinely interpose on the transport state machine end up limiting the evolvability of the transport protocol, as has been observed in the design of MPTCP <a href="#RFC6824">[RFC6824]</a> and in its subsequent deployability issues.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.2">Generally, QUIC packets are always authenticated and the payload is typically fully encrypted.  The parts of the packet header which are not encrypted are still authenticated by the receiver, so as to thwart any packet injection or manipulation by third parties.  Some early handshake packets, such as the Version Negotiation packet, are not encrypted, but information sent in these unencrypted handshake packets is later verified as part of cryptographic processing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.3">PUBLIC_RESET packets that reset a connection are currently not authenticated.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.6"><a href="#rfc.section.3.6">3.6.</a> <a href="#connection-migration-and-resilience-to-nat-rebinding" id="connection-migration-and-resilience-to-nat-rebinding">Connection Migration and Resilience to NAT Rebinding</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.1">QUIC connections are identified by a 64-bit Connection ID, randomly generated by the client.  QUIC&#8217;s consistent connection ID allows connections to survive changes to the client&#8217;s IP and port, such as those caused by NAT rebindings or by the client changing network connectivity to a new address.  QUIC provides automatic cryptographic verification of a rebound client, since the client continues to use the same session key for encrypting and decrypting packets.  The consistent connection ID can be used to allow migration of the connection to a new server IP address as well, since the Connection ID remains consistent across changes in the client&#8217;s and the server&#8217;s network addresses.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.1">QUIC version negotiation allows for multiple versions of the protocol to be deployed and used concurrently. Version negotiation is described in <a href="#version-negotiation">Section 6.1</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#versions" id="versions">Versions</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">QUIC versions are identified using a 32-bit value.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The version 0x00000000 is reserved to represent an invalid version.  This version of the specification is identified by the number 0x00000001.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">Versions with the most significant 16 bits of the version number cleared are reserved for use in future IETF consensus documents.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">Versions that follow the pattern 0x?a?a?a?a are reserved for use in forcing version negotiation to be exercised.  That is, any version number where the low four bits of all octets is 1010 (in binary).  A client or server MAY advertise support for any of these reserved versions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">Reserved version numbers will probably never represent a real protocol; a client MAY use one of these version numbers with the expectation that the server will initiate version negotiation; a server MAY advertise support for one of these versions and can expect that clients ignore the value.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.6">[[RFC editor: please remove the remainder of this section before publication.]]</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.7">The version number for the final version of this specification (0x00000001), is reserved for the version of the protocol that is published as an RFC.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.8">Version numbers used to identify IETF drafts are created by adding the draft number to 0xff000000.  For example, draft-ietf-quic-transport-13 would be identified as 0xff00000D.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">The packet number is a 64-bit unsigned number and is used as part of a cryptographic nonce for packet encryption.  Each endpoint maintains a separate packet number for sending and receiving.  The packet number for sending MUST increase by at least one after sending any packet.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">A QUIC endpoint MUST NOT reuse a packet number within the same connection (that is, under the same cryptographic keys).  If the packet number for sending reaches 2^64 - 1, the sender MUST close the connection by sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with the error code QUIC_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_LIMIT_REACHED (connection termination is described in <a href="#termination">Section 6.6</a>.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.3">To reduce the number of bits required to represent the packet number over the wire, only the least significant bits of the packet number are transmitted over the wire, up to 48 bits.  The actual packet number for each packet is reconstructed at the receiver based on the largest packet number received on a successfully authenticated packet.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.4">A packet number is decoded by finding the packet number value that is closest to the next expected packet.  The next expected packet is the highest received packet number plus one.  For example, if the highest successfully authenticated packet had a packet number of 0xaa82f30e, then a packet containing a 16-bit value of 0x1f94 will be decoded as 0xaa831f94.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.5">To enable unambiguous reconstruction of the packet number, an endpoint MUST use a packet number size that is able to represent 4 times more packet numbers than the numerical difference between the current packet number and the lowest packet number on an outstanding packet, plus one.  A packet is outstanding if it has been sent but has neither been acknowledged nor been marked as lost (see <a href="#QUIC-RECOVERY">[QUIC-RECOVERY]</a>).  As a result, the size of the packet number encoding is at least two more than the base 2 logarithm of the range of outstanding packet numbers including the new packet, rounded up.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.6">For example, if an endpoint has is sending packet 0x6B4264 and 0x6B0A2F is the lowest outstanding packet number, the next packet uses a 16-bit or larger packet number encoding; whereas a 32-bit packet number is needed if packet 0x6AF0F7 is outstanding.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.5.3.1"><a href="#rfc.section.5.3.1">5.3.1.</a> <a href="#initial-packet-number" id="initial-packet-number">Initial Packet Number</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.1">The initial value for packet number MUST be a 31-bit random number.  That is, the value is selected from an uniform random distribution between 0 and 2^31-1.  <a href="#RFC4086">[RFC4086]</a> provides guidance on the generation of random values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.2">The first set of packets sent by an endpoint MUST include the low 32-bits of the packet number.  Once any packet has been acknowledged, subsequent packets can use a shorter packet number encoding.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.5.4"><a href="#rfc.section.5.4">5.4.</a> <a href="#frames" id="frames">Frames and Frame Types</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.1">A Regular packet MUST contain at least one frame, and MAY contain multiple frames and multiple frame types.  Frames MUST fit within a single QUIC packet and MUST NOT span a QUIC packet boundary.  Each frame begins with a Frame Type byte, indicating its type, followed by additional type-dependent fields:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.2">A server that generates a version negotiation packet SHOULD include one of the reserved version numbers (those following the pattern 0x?a?a?a?a).  This ensures that clients are able to correctly handle an unsupported version.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.3">The design of version negotiation permits a server to avoid maintaining state for packets that it rejects in this fashion.  However, when the server generates a version negotiation packet, it cannot randomly generate a reserved version number.  This is because the server is required to include the same value in its transport parameters (see <a href="#version-validation">Section 6.3.4</a>).  To avoid the selected version number changing during connection establishment, the reserved version can be generated as a function of values that will be available to the server when later generating its handshake packets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.4">A pseudorandom function that takes client address information (IP and port) and the client selected version as input would ensure that there is sufficient variability in the values that a server uses.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">A QUIC connection is a single conversation between two QUIC endpoints.  QUIC&#8217;s connection establishment intertwines version negotiation with the cryptographic and transport handshakes to reduce connection establishment latency, as described in <a href="#handshake">Section 6.2</a>.  Once established, a connection may migrate to a different IP or port at either endpoint, due to NAT rebinding or mobility, as described in <a href="#migration">Section 6.5</a>.  Finally a connection may be terminated by either endpoint, as described in <a href="#termination">Section 6.6</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.6.1"><a href="#rfc.section.6.1">6.1.</a> <a href="#version-negotiation" id="version-negotiation">Version Negotiation</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">QUIC&#8217;s connection establishment begins with version negotiation, since all communication between the endpoints, including packet and frame formats, relies on the two endpoints agreeing on a version.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">A QUIC connection begins with a client sending a handshake packet. The details of the handshake mechanisms are described in <a href="#handshake">Section 6.2</a>, but all of the initial packets sent from the client to the server MUST have the VERSION flag set, and MUST specify the version of the protocol being used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.3">When the server receives a packet from a client with the VERSION flag set, it compares the client&#8217;s version to the versions it supports.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.4">If the version selected by the client is not acceptable to the server, the server discards the incoming packet and responds with a Version Negotiation packet (<a href="#version-negotiation-packet">Section 5.5</a>).  This includes the VERSION flag and a list of versions that the server will accept.  A server MUST send a Version Negotiation packet for every packet that it receives with an unacceptable version.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.5">If the packet contains a version that is acceptable to the server, the server proceeds with the handshake (<a href="#handshake">Section 6.2</a>).  All subsequent packets sent by the server MUST have the VERSION flag unset.  This commits the server to the version that the client selected.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.6">When the client receives a Version Negotiation packet from the server, it should select an acceptable protocol version.  If the server lists an acceptable version, the client selects that version and reattempts to created a connection using that version.  Though the contents of a packet might not change in response to version negotiation, a client MUST increase the packet number it uses on every packet it sends.  Packets MUST continue to have the VERSION flag set and MUST include the new negotiated protocol version.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.7">The client MUST set the VERSION flag and include its selected version on all packets until it has 1-RTT keys and it has received a packet from the server that does not have the VERSION flag set.  With TLS, this means that unprotected packets and 0-RTT protected packets all include a VERSION flag.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.8">A client MUST NOT change the version it uses unless it is in response to a Version Negotiation packet from the server.  Once a client receives a packet from the server with the VERSION flag unset, it MUST ignore the flag in subsequently received packets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.9">Version negotiation uses unprotected data. The result of the negotiation MUST be revalidated once the cryptographic handshake has completed (see <a href="#version-validation">Section 6.3.4</a>).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">QUIC relies on a combined cryptographic and transport handshake to minimize connection establishment latency.  QUIC provides a dedicated stream pair (Stream ID 1 in each direction) for the cryptographic handshake.  The first QUIC packet from the client to the server MUST carry handshake information as data on the client&#8217;s Stream ID 1.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">QUIC provides this stream with reliable, ordered delivery of data.  In return, the cryptographic handshake provides QUIC with:</p>

  <li>authenticated key exchange, where  <ul><li>a server is always authenticated,</li><li>a client is optionally authenticated,</li><li>every connection produces distinct and unrelated keys,</li><li>keying material is usable for packet protection for both 0-RTT and 1-RTT packets, and</li><li>1-RTT keys have forward secrecy</li></ul></li>
  <li>authenticated values for the transport parameters of the peer (see <a href="#transport-parameters">Section 6.3</a>)</li>

<p id="rfc.section.6.3.2.p.2">If assumed values change as a result of completing the handshake, the client is expected to respect the new values.  This introduces some potential problems, particularly with respect to transport parameters that establish limits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A client might exceed a newly declared connection or stream flow control limit with 0-RTT data.  If this occurs, the client ceases transmission as though the flow control limit was reached.

  <li>Similarly, a client might exceed the concurrent stream limit declared by the server.  A client MUST reset any streams that exceed this limit.  A server SHOULD reset any streams it cannot handle with a code that allows the client to retry any application action bound to those streams.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.2.p.4">A server MAY close a connection if remembered or assumed 0-RTT transport parameters cannot be supported, using an error code that is appropriate to the specific condition.

<h2 id="rfc.section.6.4"><a href="#rfc.section.6.4">6.4.</a> <a href="#source-address-token" id="source-address-token">Proof of Source Address Ownership</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.1">Transport protocols commonly spend a round trip checking that a client owns the transport address (IP and port) that it claims.  Verifying that a client can receive packets sent to its claimed transport address protects against spoofing of this information by malicious clients.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.2">This technique is used primarily to avoid QUIC from being used for traffic amplification attack.  In such an attack, a packet is sent to a server with spoofed source address information that identifies a victim.  If a server generates more or larger packets in response to that packet, the attacker can use the server to send more data toward the victim than it would be able to send on its own.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.3">Several methods are used in QUIC to mitigate this attack.  Firstly, the initial handshake packet from a client is padded to at least 1280 octets.  This allows a server to send a similar amount of data without risking causing an amplication attack toward an unproven remote address.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.4">A server eventually confirms that a client has received its messages when the cryptographic handshake successfully completes.  This might be insufficient, either because the server wishes to avoid the computational cost of completing the handshake, or it might be that the size of the packets that are sent during the handshake is too large.  This is especially important for 0-RTT, where the server might wish to provide application data traffic - such as a response to a request - in response to the data carried in the early data from the client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.5">To send additional data prior to completing the cryptographic handshake, the server then needs to validate that the client owns the address that it claims.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.6">Source address validation is therefore performed during the establishment of a connection.  TLS provides the tools that support the feature, but basic validation is performed by the core transport protocol.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.6.4.1"><a href="#rfc.section.6.4.1">6.4.1.</a> <a href="#client-address-validation-procedure" id="client-address-validation-procedure">Client Address Validation Procedure</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.1.p.1">QUIC uses token-based address validation.  Any time the server wishes to validate a client address, it provides the client with a token.  As long as the token cannot be easily guessed (see <a href="#token-integrity">Section 6.4.3</a>), if the client is able to return that token, it proves to the server that it received the token.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.1.p.2">During the processing of the cryptographic handshake messages from a client, TLS will request that QUIC make a decision about whether to proceed based on the information it has.  TLS will provide QUIC with any token that was provided by the client.  For an initial packet, QUIC can decide to abort the connection, allow it to proceed, or request address validation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.1.p.3">If QUIC decides to request address validation, it provides the cryptographic handshake with a token.  The contents of this token are consumed by the server that generates the token, so there is no need for a single well-defined format.  A token could include information about the claimed client address (IP and port), a timestamp, and any other supplementary information the server will need to validate the token in the future.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.1.p.4">The cryptographic handshake is responsible for enacting validation by sending the address validation token to the client.  A legitimate client will include a copy of the token when it attempts to continue the handshake.  The cryptographic handshake extracts the token then asks QUIC a second time whether the token is acceptable.  In response, QUIC can either abort the connection or permit it to proceed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.1.p.5">A connection MAY be accepted without address validation - or with only limited validation - but a server SHOULD limit the data it sends toward an unvalidated address.  Successful completion of the cryptographic handshake implicitly provides proof that the client has received packets from the server.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.6.4.2"><a href="#rfc.section.6.4.2">6.4.2.</a> <a href="#address-validation-on-session-resumption" id="address-validation-on-session-resumption">Address Validation on Session Resumption</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.2.p.1">A server MAY provide clients with an address validation token during one connection that can be used on a subsequent connection.  Address validation is especially important with 0-RTT because a server potentially sends a significant amount of data to a client in response to 0-RTT data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.2.p.2">A different type of token is needed when resuming.  Unlike the token that is created during a handshake, there might be some time between when the token is created and when the token is subsequently used.  Thus, a resumption token SHOULD include an expiration time.  It is also unlikely that the client port number is the same on two different connections; validating the port is therefore unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.2.p.3">This token can be provided to the cryptographic handshake immediately after establishing a connection.  QUIC might also generate an updated token if significant time passes or the client address changes for any reason (see <a href="#migration">Section 6.5</a>).  The cryptographic handshake is responsible for providing the client with the token.  In TLS the token is included in the ticket that is used for resumption and 0-RTT, which is carried in a NewSessionTicket message.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.6.4.3"><a href="#rfc.section.6.4.3">6.4.3.</a> <a href="#token-integrity" id="token-integrity">Address Validation Token Integrity</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.3.p.1">An address validation token MUST be difficult to guess.  Including a large enough random value in the token would be sufficient, but this depends on the server remembering the value it sends to clients.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.3.p.2">A token-based scheme allows the server to offload any state associated with validation to the client.  For this design to work, the token MUST be covered by integrity protection against modification or falsification by clients.  Without integrity protection, malicious clients could generate or guess values for tokens that would be accepted by the server.  Only the server requires access to the integrity protection key for tokens.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.3.p.3">In TLS the address validation token is often bundled with the information that TLS requires, such as the resumption secret.  In this case, adding integrity protection can be delegated to the cryptographic handshake protocol, avoiding redundant protection.  If integrity protection is delegated to the cryptographic handshake, an integrity failure will result in immediate cryptographic handshake failure.  If integrity protection is performed by QUIC, QUIC MUST abort the connection if the integrity check fails with a QUIC_ADDRESS_VALIDATION_FAILURE error code.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.6.5"><a href="#rfc.section.6.5">6.5.</a> <a href="#migration" id="migration">Connection Migration</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.1">QUIC connections are identified by their 64-bit Connection ID.  QUIC&#8217;s consistent connection ID allows connections to survive changes to the client&#8217;s IP and/or port, such as those caused by client or server migrating to a new network.  QUIC also provides automatic cryptographic verification of a client which has changed its IP address because the client continues to use the same session key for encrypting and decrypting packets.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.1">Connections should remain open until they become idle for a pre-negotiated period of time.  A QUIC connection, once established, can be terminated in one of three ways:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>Explicit Shutdown: An endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame to initiate a connection termination.  An endpoint may send a GOAWAY frame to the peer prior to a CONNECTION_CLOSE to indicate that the connection will soon be terminated.  A GOAWAY frame signals to the peer that any active streams will continue to be processed, but the sender of the GOAWAY will not initiate any additional streams and might not accept any new incoming streams. On termination of the active streams, a CONNECTION_CLOSE may be sent. If an endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame while unterminated streams are active (no FIN bit or RST_STREAM frames have been sent or received for one or more streams), then the peer must assume that the streams were incomplete and were abnormally terminated.</li>
  <li>Implicit Shutdown: The default idle timeout for a QUIC connection is 30 seconds, and is a required parameter in connection negotiation.  The maximum is 10 minutes.  If there is no network activity for the duration of the idle timeout, the connection is closed.  By default a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame will be sent.  A silent close option can be enabled when it is expensive to send an explicit close, such as mobile networks that must wake up the radio.</li>
  <li>Abrupt Shutdown: An endpoint may send a Public Reset packet at any time during the connection to abruptly terminate an active connection.  A Public Reset packet SHOULD only be used as a final recourse.  Commonly, a public reset is expected to be sent when a packet on an established connection is received by an endpoint that is unable decrypt the packet.  For instance, if a server reboots mid-connection and loses any cryptographic state associated with open connections, and then receives a packet on an open connection, it should send a Public Reset packet in return.  (TODO: articulate rules around when a public reset should be sent.)</li>

<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">The Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PTMU) is the maximum size of the entire IP header, UDP header, and UDP payload. The UDP payload includes the QUIC public header, encrypted payload, and any authentication fields.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">All QUIC packets SHOULD be sized to fit within the estimated PMTU to avoid IP fragmentation or packet drops. To optimize bandwidth efficiency, endpoints SHOULD use Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery (<a href="#RFC4821">[RFC4821]</a>) and MAY use PMTU Discovery (<a href="#RFC1191">[RFC1191]</a>, <a href="#RFC1981">[RFC1981]</a>) for detecting the PMTU, setting the PMTU appropriately, and storing the result of previous PMTU determinations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">In the absence of these mechanisms, QUIC endpoints SHOULD NOT send IP packets larger than 1280 octets. Assuming the minimum IP header size, this results in a UDP payload length of 1232 octets for IPv6 and 1252 octets for IPv4.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.4">QUIC endpoints that implement any kind of PMTU discovery SHOULD maintain an estimate for each combination of local and remote IP addresses (as each pairing could have a different maximum MTU in the path).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.5">QUIC depends on the network path supporting a MTU of at least 1280 octets. This is the IPv6 minimum and therefore also supported by most modern IPv4 networks.  An endpoint MUST NOT reduce their MTU below this number, even if it receives signals that indicate a smaller limit might exist.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.6">Clients MUST ensure that the first packet in a connection, and any retransmissions of those octets, has a total size (including IP and UDP headers) of at least 1280 bytes. This might require inclusion of PADDING frames. It is RECOMMENDED that a packet be padded to exactly 1280 octets unless the client has a reasonable assurance that the PMTU is larger. Sending a packet of this size ensures that the network path supports an MTU of this size and helps mitigate amplification attacks caused by server responses toward an unverified client address.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.7">Servers MUST reject the first plaintext packet received from a client if it its total size is less than 1280 octets, to mitigate amplification attacks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.8">If a QUIC endpoint determines that the PMTU between any pair of local and remote IP addresses has fallen below 1280 octets, it MUST immediately cease sending QUIC packets between those IP addresses. This may result in abrupt termination of the connection if all pairs are affected. In this case, an endpoint SHOULD send a Public Reset packet to indicate the failure. The application SHOULD attempt to use TLS over TCP instead.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.9">A sender bundles one or more frames in a Regular QUIC packet (see <a href="#frames">Section 5.4</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.10">A sender SHOULD minimize per-packet bandwidth and computational costs by bundling as many frames as possible within a QUIC packet.  A sender MAY wait for a short period of time to bundle multiple frames before sending a packet that is not maximally packed, to avoid sending out large numbers of small packets.  An implementation may use heuristics about expected application sending behavior to determine whether and for how long to wait.  This waiting period is an implementation decision, and an implementation should be careful to delay conservatively, since any delay is likely to increase application-visible latency.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.11">Regular QUIC packets are &#8220;containers&#8221; of frames; a packet is never retransmitted whole.  How an endpoint handles the loss of the frame depends on the type of the frame.  Some frames are simply retransmitted, some have their contents moved to new frames, and others are never retransmitted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.12">When a packet is detected as lost, the sender re-sends any frames as necessary:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>All application data sent in STREAM frames MUST be retransmitted, unless the endpoint has sent a RST_STREAM for that stream.  When an endpoint sends a RST_STREAM frame, data outstanding on that stream SHOULD NOT be retransmitted, since subsequent data on this stream is expected to not be delivered by the receiver.</li>
  <li>ACK, STOP_WAITING, and PADDING frames MUST NOT be retransmitted.  ACK and STOP_WAITING frames are cumulative, so new frames containing updated information will be sent as described in <a href="#frame-ack">Section 7.3.1</a>.</li>
  <li>All other frames MUST be retransmitted.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.14">Upon detecting losses, a sender MUST take appropriate congestion control action.  The details of loss detection and congestion control are described in <a href="#QUIC-RECOVERY">[QUIC-RECOVERY]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.15">A receiver acknowledges receipt of a received packet by sending one or more ACK frames containing the packet number of the received packet.  To avoid perpetual acknowledgment between endpoints, a receiver MUST NOT generate an ACK frame in response to every packet containing only ACK frames.  However, since it is possible that an endpoint might only send packets containing ACK frames (or other non-retransmittable frames), the receiving peer MAY send an ACK frame after a reasonable number (currently 20) of such packets have been received.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">Traditional ICMP-based path MTU discovery in IPv4 (<a href="#RFC1191">[RFC1191]</a> is potentially vulnerable to off-path attacks that successfully guess the IP/port 4-tuple and reduce the MTU to a bandwidth-inefficient value. TCP connections mitigate this risk by using the (at minimum) 8 bytes of transport header echoed in the ICMP message to validate the TCP sequence number as valid for the current connection. However, as QUIC operates over UDP, in IPv4 the echoed information could consist only of the IP and UDP headers, which usually has insufficient entropy to mitigate off-path attacks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">As a result, endpoints that implement PMTUD in IPv4 SHOULD take steps to mitigate this risk. For instance, an application could:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Set the IPv4 Don&#8217;t Fragment (DF) bit on a small proportion of packets, so that most invalid ICMP messages arrive when there are no DF packets outstanding, and can therefore be identified as spurious.</li>
  <li>Store additional information from the IP or UDP headers from DF packets (for example, the IP ID or UDP checksum) to further authenticate incoming Datagram Too Big messages.</li>
  <li>Any reduction in PMTU due to a report contained in an ICMP packet is provisional until QUIC&#8217;s loss detection algorithm determines that the packet is actually lost.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">Streams in QUIC provide a lightweight ordered byte-stream abstraction.  Each stream transfers data from the sender to the receiver, and streams with the same ID in opposite directions might or might not be related based on the application using QUIC.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">Streams can be created unilaterally, can concurrently send data interleaved with other streams, and can be cancelled. QUIC&#8217;s stream lifetime is modeled closely after HTTP/2&#8217;s <a href="#RFC7540">[RFC7540]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">Streams are independent of each other in delivery order.  That is, data that is received on a stream is delivered in order within that stream, but there is no particular delivery order across streams.  Transmit ordering among streams is left to the implementation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.4">QUIC streams are considered lightweight in that the creation and destruction of streams are expected to have minimal bandwidth and computational cost.  A single STREAM frame may create, carry data for, and terminate a stream, or a stream may last the entire duration of a connection. Implementations are therefore advised to keep these extremes in mind and to implement stream creation and destruction to be as lightweight as possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.5">An alternative view of QUIC streams is as an elastic &#8220;message&#8221; abstraction, similar to the way ephemeral streams are used in SST <a href="#SST">[SST]</a>, which may be a more appealing description for some applications.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.2">Note that this diagram shows stream state transitions and the frames and flags that affect those transitions only.  For the purpose of state transitions, the FIN flag is processed as a separate event to the frame that bears it; a STREAM frame with the FIN flag set can cause two state transitions.  When the FIN flag is sent on an empty STREAM frame, the offset in the STREAM frame MUST be one greater than the last data byte sent on this stream.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.3">Endpoints do not coordinate changes in stream state; they are created and closed unilaterally by each endpoint.  The receiver of a stream will have a delayed view of the state of a stream when frames are in transit.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.4">Streams have the following states:</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.9.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1.1">9.1.1.</a> <a href="#idle" id="idle">idle</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.1.p.1">All streams start in the &#8220;idle&#8221; state.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.1.p.2">The following transitions are valid from this state:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Sending a STREAM frame causes the stream to become &#8220;open&#8221;.  The stream identifier is selected as described in <a href="#stream-identifiers">Section 9.3</a>.  The same STREAM frame can also cause a stream to immediately become &#8220;closed&#8221;.</li>
  <li>Sending a RST_STREAM frame causes the stream to become &#8220;closed&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.1.p.4">Receiving a STREAM frame  also causes all lower-numbered &#8220;idle&#8221; streams to become &#8220;open&#8221;.  This could occur if a peer begins sending on streams in a different order to their creation, or it could happen if packets are lost or reordered in transit.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.9.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1.2">9.1.2.</a> <a href="#open" id="open">open</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.2.p.1">A stream in the &#8220;open&#8221; state may be used to transfer data.  In this state, a sending peer must observe the flow-control limit advertised by its receiving peer (<a href="#flow-control">Section 10</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.2.p.2">From this state, the sender send a STREAM frame with the FIN flag set or a RST_STREAM frame.  These indicate the clean or abrupt termination of data flow on the stream, respectively.  In either case, this causes the stream to transition into the &#8220;closed&#8221; state. The receiving endpoint MUST NOT process the FIN flag until all preceding data on the stream has been received, but MAY process a RST_STREAM frame immediately and discard any preceding data.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.9.1.3"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1.3">9.1.3.</a> <a href="#state-closed" id="state-closed">closed</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.3.p.1">The &#8220;closed&#8221; state is the terminal state.  No further frames will be generated by either peer, though the receiving peer&#8217;s frames can continue to arrive until it realizes that the stream has closed.  Such frames MUST be quietly discarded.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.3.p.2">An endpoint will learn the final offset of the data it receives on a stream when it enters the &#8220;closed&#8221; state.  The final offset is carried explicitly in the RST_STREAM frame; otherwise, the final offset is the offset of the end of the data carried in STREAM frame marked with a FIN flag.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.3.p.3">An endpoint MUST NOT send data on a stream at or beyond the final offset.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.3.p.4">Once a final offset for a stream is known, it cannot change.  If a RST_STREAM or STREAM frame causes the final offset to change for a stream, an endpoint SHOULD respond with a QUIC_STREAM_DATA_AFTER_TERMINATION error (see <a href="#error-handling">Section 11</a>).  A receiver SHOULD treat receipt of data at or beyond the final offset as a QUIC_STREAM_DATA_AFTER_TERMINATION error.  Generating these errors is not mandatory, but only because requiring that an endpoint generate these errors also means that the endpoint needs to maintain the final offset state for closed streams, which could mean a significant state commitment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.3.p.5">In the absence of more specific guidance elsewhere in this document, implementations SHOULD treat the receipt of a frame that is not expressly permitted in the description of a state as a connection error (<a href="#error-handling">Section 11</a>).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.1">If an endpoint is no longer interested in the data being received, it MAY send a REQUEST_RST frame on a stream in the &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;half-closed (local)&#8221; state to request closure of the stream in the opposite direction.  This typically indicates that the receiving application is no longer reading from the stream and all future data will be discarded upon receipt.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.2">STREAM frames received after sending REQUEST_RST are still counted toward the connection and stream flow-control windows.  Even though these frames will be discarded, because they are sent before their sender receives the REQUEST_RST, the sender will consider the frames to count against its flow-control windows.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.3">Upon receipt of a REQUEST_RST frame, an endpoint SHOULD send a RST_STREAM with an error code of QUIC_RECEIVED_RST.  If the REQUEST_RST frame is received on a stream that is already in the &#8220;half-closed (local)&#8221; or &#8220;closed&#8221; states, a RST_STREAM frame SHOULD still be sent and retransmission of previously-sent STREAM frames SHOULD be cancelled.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.9.3"><a href="#rfc.section.9.3">9.3.</a> <a href="#stream-identifiers" id="stream-identifiers">Stream Identifiers</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.1">Streams in each direction are identified by an unsigned 32-bit integer, referred to as the Stream ID. Streams with the same Stream ID in opposite directions might or might not be related to each other, depending on the application&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.2">Stream ID zero (0x0) is reserved and used for connection-level flow control frames (<a href="#flow-control">Section 10</a>); Stream ID zero cannot be used to establish a new stream.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.3">Stream ID 1 (0x1) in each direction is reserved for the crypto handshake. Stream ID 1 MUST NOT be used for application data, and MUST be the first stream initiated by each peer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.4">A QUIC endpoint cannot reuse a StreamID on a given connection.  Streams MUST be created in sequential order.  Open streams can be used in any order.  Streams that are used out of order result in lower-numbered streams in the same direction being counted as open.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.5">All streams, including stream 1, count toward this limit.  Thus, a concurrent stream limit of 0 will cause a connection to be unusable.  Application protocols that use QUIC might require a certain minimum number of streams to function correctly.  If a peer advertises an concurrent stream limit (concurrent_streams) that is too small for the selected application protocol to function, an endpoint MUST terminate the connection with an error of type QUIC_TOO_MANY_OPEN_STREAMS (<a href="#error-handling">Section 11</a>).</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.9.4"><a href="#rfc.section.9.4">9.4.</a> <a href="#stream-concurrency" id="stream-concurrency">Stream Concurrency</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.1">An endpoint limits the number of concurrently active incoming streams by setting the concurrent stream limit (see <a href="#transport-parameter-definitions">Section 6.3.1</a>) in the transport parameters. The maximum concurrent streams setting is specific to each endpoint and applies only to the peer that receives the setting. That is, clients specify the maximum number of concurrent streams the server can initiate, and servers specify the maximum number of concurrent streams the client can initiate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.2">Streams that are in the &#8220;open&#8221; state count toward the maximum number of streams that an endpoint is permitted to open.  Streams in any of these three states count toward the limit advertised in the concurrent stream limit.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.3">Endpoints MUST NOT exceed the limit set by their peer.  An endpoint that receives a STREAM frame that causes its advertised concurrent stream limit to be exceeded MUST treat this as a stream error of type QUIC_TOO_MANY_OPEN_STREAMS (<a href="#error-handling">Section 11</a>).</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.9.5"><a href="#rfc.section.9.5">9.5.</a> <a href="#sending-data" id="sending-data">Sending Data</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.1">Once a stream is created, the initiator can use the stream to send data. This is transmitted as a series of STREAM frames encapsulating data on a stream until the stream is terminated.  Streams are an ordered byte-stream abstraction, and they have no other structure within them.  STREAM frame boundaries are not expected to be preserved in retransmissions from the sender or during delivery to the application at the receiver.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.2">When new data is to be sent on a stream, a sender MUST set the encapsulating STREAM frame&#8217;s offset field to the stream offset of the first byte of this new data.  The first byte of data that is sent on a stream has the stream offset 0.  A receiver MUST ensure that received stream data is delivered to the application as an ordered byte-stream.  Data received out of order MUST be buffered for later delivery, as long as it is not in violation of the receiver&#8217;s flow control limits.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.3">The cryptographic handshake stream, Stream 1, MUST NOT be subject to congestion control or connection-level flow control, but MUST be subject to stream-level flow control. An endpoint MUST NOT send data on any other stream without consulting the congestion controller and the flow controller.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.4">Flow control is described in detail in <a href="#flow-control">Section 10</a>, and congestion control is described in the companion document <a href="#QUIC-RECOVERY">[QUIC-RECOVERY]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.5">Streams carry data from sender to receiver.  If the receiver needs to respond to the transferred data, it opens a stream in the opposite direction.  Application protocols which require this behavior MUST define how to identify which stream(s) will be used for responses.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.9.6"><a href="#rfc.section.9.6">9.6.</a> <a href="#stream-prioritization" id="stream-prioritization">Stream Prioritization</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.1">Stream multiplexing has a significant effect on application performance if resources allocated to streams are correctly prioritized.  Experience with other multiplexed protocols, such as HTTP/2 <a href="#RFC7540">[RFC7540]</a>, shows that effective prioritization strategies have a significant positive impact on performance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.2">QUIC does not provide frames for exchanging priotization information.  Instead it relies on receiving priority information from the application that uses QUIC.  Protocols that use QUIC are able to define any prioritization scheme that suits their application semantics.  A protocol might define explicit messages for signaling priority, such as those defined in HTTP/2; it could define rules that allow an endpoint to determine priority based on context; or it could leave the determination to the application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.3">A QUIC implementation SHOULD provide ways in which an application can indicate the relative priority of streams.  When deciding which streams to dedicate resources to, QUIC SHOULD use the information provided by the application.  Failure to account for priority of streams can result in suboptimal performance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.4">Stream priority is most relevant when deciding which stream data will be transmitted.  Often, there will be limits on what can be transmitted as a result of connection flow control or the current congestion controller state.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.5">Giving preference to the transmission of its own management frames ensures that the protocol functions efficiently.  That is, prioritizing frames other than STREAM frames ensures that loss recovery, congestion control, and flow control operate effectively.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.6">Stream 1 MUST be prioritized over other streams prior to the completion of the cryptographic handshake.  This includes the retransmission of the second flight of client handshake messages, that is, the TLS Finished and any client authentication messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.6.p.7">STREAM frames that are determined to be lost SHOULD be retransmitted before sending new data, unless application priorities indicate otherwise.  Retransmitting lost STREAM frames can fill in gaps, which allows the peer to consume already received data and free up flow control window.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.10"><a href="#rfc.section.10">10.</a> <a href="#flow-control" id="flow-control">Flow Control</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">It is necessary to limit the amount of data that a sender may have outstanding at any time, so as to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver, or to prevent a malicious sender from consuming significant resources at a receiver.  This section describes QUIC&#8217;s flow-control mechanisms.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">QUIC employs a credit-based flow-control scheme similar to HTTP/2&#8217;s flow control <a href="#RFC7540">[RFC7540]</a>.  A receiver advertises the number of octets it is prepared to receive on a given stream and for the entire connection.  This leads to two levels of flow control in QUIC: (i) Connection flow control, which prevents senders from exceeding a receiver&#8217;s buffer capacity for the connection, and (ii) Stream flow control, which prevents a single stream from consuming the entire receive buffer for a connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">A receiver sends WINDOW_UPDATE frames to the sender to advertise additional credit by sending the absolute byte offset in the stream or in the connection which it is willing to receive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.4">The initial flow control credit is 65536 bytes for both the stream and connection flow controllers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.5">A receiver MAY advertise a larger offset at any point in the connection by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE frame.  A receiver MUST NOT renege on an advertisement; that is, once a receiver advertises an offset via a WINDOW_UPDATE frame, it MUST NOT subsequently advertise a smaller offset.  A sender may receive WINDOW_UPDATE frames out of order; a sender MUST therefore ignore any WINDOW_UPDATE that does not move the window forward.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.6">A receiver MUST close the connection with a QUIC_FLOW_CONTROL_RECEIVED_TOO_MUCH_DATA error (<a href="#error-handling">Section 11</a>) if the peer violates the advertised stream or connection flow control windows.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.7">A sender MUST send BLOCKED frames to indicate it has data to write but is blocked by lack of connection or stream flow control credit.  BLOCKED frames are expected to be sent infrequently in common cases, but they are considered useful for debugging and monitoring purposes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.8">A receiver advertises credit for a stream by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with the StreamID set appropriately. A receiver may use the current offset of data consumed to determine the flow control offset to be advertised.  A receiver MAY send copies of a WINDOW_UPDATE frame in multiple packets in order to make sure that the sender receives it before running out of flow control credit, even if one of the packets is lost.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.9">Connection flow control is a limit to the total bytes of stream data sent in STREAM frames on all streams contributing to connection flow control.  A receiver advertises credit for a connection by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with the StreamID set to zero (0x00).  A receiver maintains a cumulative sum of bytes received on all streams contributing to connection-level flow control, to check for flow control violations. A receiver may maintain a cumulative sum of bytes consumed on all contributing streams to determine the connection-level flow control offset to be advertised.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.10.1"><a href="#rfc.section.10.1">10.1.</a> <a href="#edge-cases-and-other-considerations" id="edge-cases-and-other-considerations">Edge Cases and Other Considerations</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.10.1.p.1">There are some edge cases which must be considered when dealing with stream and connection level flow control.  Given enough time, both endpoints must agree on flow control state.  If one end believes it can send more than the other end is willing to receive, the connection will be torn down when too much data arrives.  Conversely if a sender believes it is blocked, while endpoint B expects more data can be received, then the connection can be in a deadlock, with the sender waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE which will never come.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.10.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.10.1.1">10.1.1.</a> <a href="#mid-stream-rststream" id="mid-stream-rststream">Mid-stream RST_STREAM</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.10.1.1.p.1">On receipt of a RST_STREAM frame, an endpoint will tear down state for the matching stream and ignore further data arriving on that stream.  This could result in the endpoints getting out of sync, since the RST_STREAM frame may have arrived out of order and there may be further bytes in flight.  The data sender would have counted the data against its connection level flow control budget, but a receiver that has not received these bytes would not know to include them as well.  The receiver must learn the number of bytes that were sent on the stream to make the same adjustment in its connection flow controller.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.1.1.p.2">To avoid this de-synchronization, a RST_STREAM sender MUST include the final byte offset sent on the stream in the RST_STREAM frame.  On receiving a RST_STREAM frame, a receiver definitively knows how many bytes were sent on that stream before the RST_STREAM frame, and the receiver MUST use the final offset to account for all bytes sent on the stream in its connection level flow controller.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.10.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.10.1.2">10.1.2.</a> <a href="#response-to-a-rststream" id="response-to-a-rststream">Response to a RST_STREAM</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.10.1.2.p.1">RST_STREAM terminates a stream abruptly.  Whether any action or response can or should be taken on the data already received is an application-specific issue, but it will often be the case that upon receipt of a RST_STREAM an endpoint will choose to stop sending data in its own direction. If the sender of a RST_STREAM wishes to explicitly state that no future data will be processed, that endpoint MAY send a REQUEST_RST frame at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.10.1.3"><a href="#rfc.section.10.1.3">10.1.3.</a> <a href="#offset-increment" id="offset-increment">Offset Increment</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.10.1.3.p.1">This document leaves when and how many bytes to advertise in a WINDOW_UPDATE to the implementation, but offers a few considerations.  WINDOW_UPDATE frames constitute overhead, and therefore, sending a WINDOW_UPDATE with small offset increments is undesirable.  At the same time, sending WINDOW_UPDATES with large offset increments requires the sender to commit to that amount of buffer.  Implementations must find the correct tradeoff between these sides to determine how large an offset increment to send in a WINDOW_UPDATE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.1.3.p.2">A receiver MAY use an autotuning mechanism to tune the size of the offset increment to advertise based on a roundtrip time estimate and the rate at which the receiving application consumes data, similar to common TCP implementations.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.10.1.4"><a href="#rfc.section.10.1.4">10.1.4.</a> <a href="#blocked-frames" id="blocked-frames">BLOCKED frames</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.10.1.4.p.1">If a sender does not receive a WINDOW_UPDATE frame when it has run out of flow control credit, the sender will be blocked and MUST send a BLOCKED frame.  A BLOCKED frame is expected to be useful for debugging at the receiver.  A receiver SHOULD NOT wait for a BLOCKED frame before sending a WINDOW_UPDATE, since doing so will cause at least one roundtrip of quiescence.  For smooth operation of the congestion controller, it is generally considered best to not let the sender go into quiescence if avoidable.  To avoid blocking a sender, and to reasonably account for the possibiity of loss, a receiver should send a WINDOW_UPDATE frame at least two roundtrips before it expects the sender to get blocked.</p>

<h2 id="rfc.section.12.1"><a href="#rfc.section.12.1">12.1.</a> <a href="#spoofed-ack-attack" id="spoofed-ack-attack">Spoofed ACK Attack</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.12.1.p.1">An attacker receives an STK from the server and then releases the IP address on which it received the STK.  The attacker may, in the future, spoof this same address (which now presumably addresses a different endpoint), and initiate a 0-RTT connection with a server on the victim&#8217;s behalf.  The attacker then spoofs ACK frames to the server which cause the server to potentially drown the victim in data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.1.p.2">There are two possible mitigations to this attack.  The simplest one is that a server can unilaterally create a gap in packet-number space.  In the non-attack scenario, the client will send an ACK frame with the larger value for largest acknowledged.  In the attack scenario, the attacker could acknowledge a packet in the gap.  If the server sees an acknowledgment for a packet that was never sent, the connection can be aborted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.12.1.p.3">The second mitigation is that the server can require that acknowledgments for sent packets match the encryption level of the sent packet.  This mitigation is useful if the connection has an ephemeral forward-secure key that is generated and used for every new connection.  If a packet sent is encrypted with a forward-secure key, then any acknowledgments that are received for them MUST also be forward-secure encrypted.  Since the attacker will not have the forward secure key, the attacker will not be able to generate forward-secure encrypted packets with ACK frames.</p>
